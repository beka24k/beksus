# MyHashTable
MyHashTable is a custom implementation of a hash table data structure in Java. It allows for efficient key-value pair lookups and is useful for storing large amounts of data that need to be quickly searchable.

## Getting Started
To use MyHashTable in your Java project, you can simply download the MyHashTable.java file and include it in your project's source code. Alternatively, you can clone this repository and import the MyHashTable.java file into your project.

## Usage
To create a new instance of MyHashTable, you can use the following code:
```ruby
MyHashTable<String, Integer> table = new MyHashTable<>();
```
This will create a new hash table with String __keys__ and Integer __values__.
## Adding and Retrieving Values
To add a new __key-value__ pair to the hash table, you can use the put method:
```ruby
table.put("key", 123);
```
To retrieve the value associated with a given key, you can use the __get__ method:
```ruby
Integer value = table.get("key");
```
If the key is not found in the hash table, __get__ will return null.
## Removing Values
To remove a key-value pair from the hash table, you can use the __remove__ method:
```ruby
Integer removedValue = table.remove("key");
```
This will remove the key-value pair associated with the given key and return the value that was removed. If the key is not found in the hash table, __remove__ will return null.

## Other Methods
MyHashTable also provides additional methods for checking if a value exists in the hash table, retrieving a key associated with a given value, and counting the number of elements in each bucket of the hash table.
